DRL(data retrieving language):

  it is used to extract data fron the table.

basic syntax:

  select [all/distinct] <coloumn list/*> from table
      [where condition]
      [group by <grouping column list>]
      [having <group condition>]
      [order by<column> ASC/DESC];

=>queries may have clauses for different purpose.


clauses:
 
  clause is a part of the query.
  every clause have specific purpose.
  
present in this tutorial,we only cover the where clause only.


different types of using the select query.
   1)all columns and all rows
   2)all columns and specific rows.
   3)specific columns and all rows.
   4)specific columns and specific rows.


1)all columns AND all rows:
  
   select * from table_name;

2)all columns and specific rows:
   
   select * from table_name where condition;

3)specific columns and all  rows:
  
   select column_name from table_name;

4)specific rows and specifc columns:
  
   select column_name from table_name where condition;


priority of execution:
  when we have 1)select caluse
               2)from clause
               3)where clause

 *we will discuss remaining clause order in future


     3)select * 
     1)from table
     2)where condtion
